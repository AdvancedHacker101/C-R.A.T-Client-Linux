# C R.A.T Client Linux
This is a client integrating some of the functions of [C# R.A.T Client](https://github.com/AdvancedHacker101/C-Sharp-R.A.T-Client/)  
This client is written in c and uses the standard linux libraries, and some commands, like: pidof, eject, bash, gsettings, kill  
Version: 1.0 - beta  
Functions that are working with the linuxClient:  
- Getting info (machine name, ip address, time)
- Popping messagebox (opening a new terminal, with the message) -only with graphical versions
- Hiding desktop -only with graphical versions
- CD Tray (open and close)
- Processes (listing, killing, starting) -can't start hidden processes
- Remote cmd (open, close, read, write) -using bash as shell interface  

Functions planned to be added: 
- [ ] File management
- [ ] Remote Desktop (not sure)
- [ ] DDoS  

**Warning**: traffic sent and/or received by the linuxClient is **Not encrypted**  
Note that this is very experimental and may not work as intended!
